# Portable Career Portal
_This project is currently early access, because of this there may be some rough edges and major changes over the following weeks._


This is a simple job portal that can be used to embed Bullhorn* jobs wherever you have access to embed code.  This includes Squarespace, Godaddy, Wix and other website builders

## Usage

And add the following wherever you want your jobs to show.
```
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/portable-career-portal"></script> <!-- this may need to be added somewhere else -->
    <career-portal swimlane="[your swimlane]" corpToken="[your corp Token]" jobsPerPage="5" />
```

## Details
This project creates a career-portal webcomponent for use on your website.
